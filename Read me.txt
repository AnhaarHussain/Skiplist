                                                            "Code File includes"
--This code includes two classes (Node , Skiplist)
--This code includes three main functions that are "add" ,  "find" and "remove".
--This code includes two supporting functions which includes "Pre_Node" and "Pick_Height".
--This code includes "Print" function for the implementation of Skiplist.

                                                                "How to Use"

--First you have to give the maximum level you want.
--You can insert your values in the skiplist by calling the "add" function in the code by giving it the key.
--You can search your values in the skiplist by calling the "get" function in the code by providing the key.
--You can delete your values in the skiplist by calling the "remove" function in the code.
--You can use "print" function to display the implementation of skiplist.

                                                                "Precautions"

--Don't try to make changes in this code, if you try to do this , you will get error.
--Some values are there in the driver code to show the implementation step by step.

                                                             "Overall Complexity"

--Each function in this code is implemented in O(logn).
